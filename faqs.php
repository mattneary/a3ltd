	<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
	<br>
	<h5>How does this thingamabob work?</h5>
	<p>
	Oversimplifying it a tad bit, we are like the cupid of the contractor/client world. We are a few
	unsatisfied users of other sites that many people use to find contractors or advertise on. So we
	created a solution where we get hands-on and match people and companies up with each other (not in like...a 
	weird way or anything like that). We have had tremendous success so far and we hope to continue our
	astonishing rate of customer satisfaction. So if you want to be satisfied maybe you can help us out 
	with that?
	</p><br>
	<h5>How do I make payments?</h5>
	<p>
	Not only are we affordable, but we make the payment process easy! We use a quick, easy, and secure
	payment form that processes your information simply. Payment information processed by Stripe in
	a secure manner, which you can read more about in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
